SL2AY021 Phonetics
======
During the academic year 2023-2024, I had the honor of co-teaching the course "SL2AY021 Phonetics" alongside my colleague, [Li Chenyu](http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/en/Gens/Chenyu-li). My responsibilities included leading six lecture sessions and six tutorial sessions, where students were introduced to the essential concepts of phonetics and provided practical hands-on experience with tools such as Praat and Prosody Pro.
