Hello and welcome! I am thrilled to embark on this exciting doctoral journey and share my academic pursuits on prosody and acoustic phonetics with you!

**About me**

I am Zhou Ziqi, a first-year Ph.D. student from [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/linguistique/). 


**Advisors: Prof. Chitoran and Prof. Al-Tamimi**

I am very fortunate to be under guidance of two distinguished supervisors, [Prof. Ioana Chitoran](https://clillac-arp.u-paris.fr/annuaire/chitoran-ioana) and [Prof. Jalal Al-Tamimi](http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/fr/Gens/Al-Tamimi).  


**Affiliation with CLILLAC-ARP and LLF**

I am proud to be affiliated with [CLILLAC-ARP](https://clillac-arp.u-paris.fr) and [LLF](http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/fr). 


**Doctoral Research**

My research project, "Phonological Transfer in L3 Acquisition of Ironic Tone of Voice," explores the processes of acquiring the ironic tone of voice in a third language (L3) among Mandarin-English bilinguals learning French. This study incorporates acoustic and perceptual analyses to delve into the fascinating world of phonological transfer, with a specific focus on key components:

  Emotional Prosodic Variation: Investigating how emotional prosodic cues affect tone perception.

  Speech Production in Learner Varieties: Analyzing how learners' speech production evolves during multilingual acquisition.

  Language-Specific Prosodic Cues in Online Sentence Comprehension: Exploring the role of language-specific prosody in real-time sentence processing.
